# Movie sharing social platform

### Details
This is a web database management project 
The project utalizes JS, HTML/CSS, PHP, and SQL 

I decided to not utalize any large frameworks in order to get experience with a vanilla techstack. 

While I do experiement with page styles, the main goal is for it to be functional and user friendly. AJAX is utalized to avoid page reloads to ensure a good user experience, and movie collections are saved to a database.


### Dependencies
Php, mysql

### Enviroment
Visual Std Code, mysql workbench, XAMPP (apache) ,extensions: mysql tools

### Base Functionality
View existing data in the database, and manipulate/ add to it. 

Users will be able to add/ remove movies from their collection, and view their collections.

### Future
File uploads for movie posters, and more page styling.
