# Movie sharing social platform

### Details
This is a web database management project for my CSCI 130 course (Fall, 2024). 
The project utalizes JS, HTML/CSS, PHP, and SQL for an album management social
platform. 

I decided to not utalize any large frameworks in order to get experience with a vanilla techstack. 
There is a similar project that I have forked, which utalizes a larger/ more mordern techstack. This 
is also being worked on for a class. 

### Dependencies
Php, mysql, python

### Enviroment
Visual Std Code, mysql workbench, XAMPP (apache) ,extensions: mysql tools

### Base Functionality
The aim is to utalize a music API, to store user selected movie in an sql database. Users will be able to store/share their favorite (Or least favorite) movies to their page, and give their own personal reviews and opinions. 

Users will be able to create accounts, and maintain their pages, with an about me section, a list of movies they've reviewed, along with their current favorite movies.

While the main aim is database management, I'm also striving to ensure best security practices in terms of authentication, and user data. 

Furthermore, while styling is not a major component, I'm aiming to keep everything that is styled responsive and user-friendly. 

### Inspiration


### Future
I'd like to eventually expand this to include songs as well. Users will eventually be able to have a friends list, and be able to share collections of their 
recent finds/listens in a post similar to instagram, with comments and sharing being a component.
